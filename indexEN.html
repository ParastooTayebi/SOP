                <span> Growth is an iterative and endless process. We do not go wrong when we learn something new,
                    We go from mistake to error, and so we are always in the process of approaching truth and perfection,
                    Without ever really reaching the truth and perfection. (Mark Manson)
                </span>
                <span> I am Fatemeh Taybi, nicknamed Parasto, a seeker of knowledge! Ever since I got to know the world of technology and technology
                    I was very interested in information. This led me to study computer engineering two years ago, which was my only goal
                    I choose.
                </span>
                <span> At first, I was accepted to the self-governing campus of Sharif University of Technology, but then because of an untimely event that happened in my life
                    Dad changed the course of my life and I was transferred to Payame Noor University, so that I could stay at my place of residence
                    I also study and use this feature of the university, which is not mandatory for attending classes, and my job
                    Find a suitable one.
                </span>
                <span> I was also interested in art from the beginning, so I am always trying to find these two important elements.
                    My life means combining technology and art and creating something that gives color to both life and the future.
                    See progress in it.
                </span>
                <span> Now mastering Photoshop, Premiere and to some extent After Effects in the photography studio
                    I am employed. In addition, I have a history of teaching privately as well as teaching in primary and secondary schools.
                    I am in the first year and I have been teaching elementary education at the ICDL Children's Intellectual Center for some time.
                </span>
                <span> And last but not least, my goal in life is to build a better and more just world for myself and others.
                    .
